# Module 8: Optimization

This module optimizes the game engine through frustum culling. There are two frustums, one static and one attached to the camera. If an object is visible within either, it is rendered.
- 1, 2, and 3 will bring the camera to locations that highlight the effects of frustum culling
- x will reset the camera so that it is facing positive x with normal positive z
- r will speed up the objects
- f will slow down the objects and can stop and reverse them
